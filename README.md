# Illinois Chat

Illinois Chat is a self-hostable AI chat platform for building course, research, and organization-specific assistants over curated documents and web content.

This repository contains the full monorepo needed to run Illinois Chat locally or in a Docker-based self-hosted environment.

## What Is Included

- `apps/frontend`: Next.js web application.
- `apps/backend`: Flask API and ingest worker.
- `apps/crawlee`: Crawlee service for web crawling.
- `infra/docker`: Docker Compose files for full-stack and local-development runs.
- `infra/db`: Postgres schema and database configuration.
- `infra/keycloak`: Keycloak realm and theme assets.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.10 or 3.11 for local backend development
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ for local frontend development

## Quickstart

Use the full Docker stack when you want the closest self-hosted or e2e environment. It starts the application services and all required infrastructure.

```bash
# First run (empty database): create the schema too
bash infra/scripts/start-all.sh --create-schema

# Later runs (database already initialized)
bash infra/scripts/start-all.sh
```

The script creates a repository-root `.env` from `.env.template` if needed, starts the frontend, backend, ingest worker, Crawlee, Postgres (pgvector-enabled `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`), Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, Qdrant, and Keycloak, then initializes the database (with `--create-schema` or `--wipe_data`) and Qdrant collection. Stopping the stack with `infra/scripts/stop-all.sh` keeps the volumes, so the database survives stop/start cycles without recreating the schema.

**Upgrading a stack created before the Postgres mount moved** (both `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.dev.yaml` now mount `postgres-illinois-chat` at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`). The old parent mount let Docker shadow the image's declared data directory with an anonymous volume, so the real cluster never lived in the named volume and was orphaned on every `down` + `up`. An existing `postgres-illinois-chat` volume therefore holds only an empty `data/` mount point, and Postgres refuses to initialise into a non-empty directory. Either reset (`start-all.sh --wipe_data`, `start-dev.sh --clean`, or `stop-*.sh --volumes`) or remove the stale directory: `docker run --rm -v <project>_postgres-illinois-chat:/v alpine rmdir /v/data`. If you have data to keep, it is still in the old anonymous volume: stop the stack, find it with `docker volume ls -qf dangling=true` (a 64-character name), then `docker run --rm -v <that-volume>:/from -v <project>_postgres-illinois-chat:/to alpine sh -c 'rmdir /to/data && cp -a /from/. /to/'` before starting again. The `postgres-keycloak` service is now pinned to `postgres:18`, which is what the previously unpinned tag already resolved to, so no Keycloak data migration is needed.

To reset local Docker data before starting:

```bash
bash infra/scripts/start-all.sh --wipe_data
```

`--wipe_data` recreates the database schema on the fresh volumes, so it cannot be combined with `--create-schema`.

To stop the full stack:

```bash
bash infra/scripts/stop-all.sh

# also remove full-stack volumes
bash infra/scripts/stop-all.sh --volumes

# stop only the full stack and leave the Sim AI containers running
bash infra/scripts/stop-all.sh --no-sim
```

## Local Development

Use the dev stack when you want to run app processes directly with hot reload while Docker provides shared infrastructure.

```bash
bash infra/scripts/start-dev.sh
```

This starts `infra/docker/docker-compose.dev.yaml` and non-destructively creates or appends missing keys in:

- `apps/backend/.env`
- `apps/frontend/.env`
- `apps/crawlee/.env`

Run the backend, ingest worker, and frontend in separate terminals:

```bash
cd apps/backend
flask --app ai_ta_backend.main:app --debug run --port 8000
```

```bash
cd apps/backend
python ai_ta_backend/rabbitmq/worker.py
```

```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm run local
```

To stop local development infrastructure:

```bash
bash infra/scripts/stop-dev.sh

# also remove local-development volumes
bash infra/scripts/stop-dev.sh --volumes

# stop only the dev infrastructure and leave the Sim AI containers running
bash infra/scripts/stop-dev.sh --no-sim
```

### Sim AI Local Stack

Two guides cover Sim. For the user-facing side — signing in via Keycloak SSO, the admin approval flow, connecting a Sim workspace to a project's tools, and which blocks are available — see [`docs/sim-user-guide.md`](docs/sim-user-guide.md). For how the stack fits together, how Illinois Chat talks to Sim, the block whitelist and upgrade procedure — see [`docs/sim-developer-guide.md`](docs/sim-developer-guide.md).

The full and dev Docker stacks also start Sim AI against the same local Keycloak realm for SSO testing while keeping Sim's pgvector database isolated. No separate Sim checkout is required; the stack uses the upstream Sim container images.

- Sim app: `http://localhost:3010`
- Sim realtime: `http://localhost:3011`
- Sim pgvector Postgres: `localhost:55432`
- Shared Keycloak: `http://localhost:8080`

Sim SSO uses the same local Keycloak realm as the app. Keycloak owns user authentication and creates Sim identities through the OIDC callback; the stack does not seed test users or passwords. `SIM_SSO_DOMAIN` is the single email domain routed to this Keycloak provider and defaults to `illinois.edu`; it must be one registrable domain, because Sim denies a sign-in whose email domain does not equal it once both are normalised, and a comma-separated list normalises to nothing and so denies every sign-in. New Sim users are held in a pending state until a Sim platform admin approves them with the existing Unban action under Settings > Admin. `SIM_APPROVAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` identifies the bootstrap platform admin; it has no default — set it to your address in `.env`, or the Sim stack refuses to start. This approval gate is implemented in Sim's database (see `infra/docker/sim/approval-setup.sql`) so the stack can continue using the upstream Sim images; approving, blocking, or re-blocking an email in the `sim_user_approval` table takes effect immediately, ending any live sessions of a blocked user. Sim's five secrets — `SIM_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SIM_BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `SIM_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SIM_INTERNAL_API_SECRET` and the Keycloak OIDC client secret `SIM_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` — have no defaults; the stack refuses to start without them, and `start-dev.sh` / `start-all.sh` generate deployment-specific values into the root `.env` on first run (an existing `.env` still carrying the old published default `simai-local-secret` is rotated the same way). `SIM_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts Sim API keys at rest inside Sim and must be exactly 64 hexadecimal characters (`openssl rand -hex 32`). On the Illinois Chat side, the Sim API key each project admin pastes on the Tools page is encrypted at rest with `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` (the same key that protects project external connections); both start scripts generate it once, and changing it afterwards means every project's Sim key must be re-entered. Outbound Sim requests are limited to sim.ai, `SIM_API_BASE_URL`'s origin, and any origins listed in `SIM_ALLOWED_SIM_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) — a project's Sim base URL must be one of these.

Which Sim blocks users may place in a workflow is restricted by `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS`, whose value is `ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS` in `.env` — the single place the list lives, shipped in full in `.env.template`. The builder-facing view of that list is section 5 of the Sim user guide linked above. Four properties of this variable are easy to get wrong. It is enforced on its own, with no access-control or enterprise licence needed. **A variable Sim receives as empty means unrestricted, not restricted**, so the compose file deliberately has no default and uses `${ALLOWED_INTEGRATIONS:?…}`: a missing or blank value stops the Sim stack from starting rather than silently removing the policy. The value replaces the list wholesale — there is no merge, so adding one vendor means adding its id to the existing line, not setting the variable to that id alone. Ids are matched exactly and case-insensitively with no version resolution on the pinned image, so `slack` does not permit `slack_v2`. Core blocks are not exempt, so omitting `agent` or `function` breaks every workflow. Enforcement happens when a block executes, not when a workflow is saved, so a workflow containing a denied block can still be saved or imported and will fail only on a run; a denied vendor attached as an agent *tool* is dropped silently and the agent runs without it. MCP servers are not restricted by host in this release. To lift the restriction entirely you must set the variable to every id you want allowed; there is no longer a shipped default to fall back on.

The Sim images are pinned by digest rather than tracking `latest`, so upgrading Sim is a deliberate change: the approval gate above patches Sim's own `user` table, and an unreviewed upgrade could break — or open — it. To move to a newer Sim, resolve the digest with `docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/simstudioai/simstudio:latest` and set `SIM_APP_IMAGE` (and the matching `SIM_REALTIME_IMAGE` / `SIM_MIGRATIONS_IMAGE`) in `.env`. Override other `SIM_*` values there if ports or credentials need to change. A digest bump also needs the whitelist re-checked: every id must still exist in the new image, and upstream later canonicalizes block versions, which would silently widen the list by making an allowed id permit its successors.

## Configuration

There are two environment modes:

- Full Docker/e2e reads the repository-root `.env`.
- Local development reads `apps/backend/.env`, `apps/frontend/.env`, and `apps/crawlee/.env`.

Change default passwords before using any non-local environment. Hosted model, embedding, and API-key values are intentionally generated as empty keys so each deployment can choose its own providers.

Inside Docker, services talk to each other through Compose names such as `backend`, `minio`, `qdrant`, and `postgres-illinois-chat`. Browser-facing URLs use localhost.

### MinIO

Use the MinIO API endpoint for uploads and presigned URLs, not the MinIO console port.

- Full Docker/e2e API: `http://localhost:9000`
- Local development API: `http://localhost:10000`
- MinIO console: `http://localhost:9001`

## Common Commands

```bash
# rebuild only the frontend image
bash infra/scripts/start-all.sh --rebuild=frontend

# rebuild both frontend and backend images
bash infra/scripts/start-all.sh --rebuild=frontend,backend
```

## Documentation

See `DEV_SETUP.md` for local development details. Published docs are available at https://docs.uiuc.chat.

Projects can bring their own S3, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Qdrant, and embedding
provider — see [`docs/external-connections-setup.md`](docs/external-connections-setup.md)
for provisioning an external database and registering per-project connections.
